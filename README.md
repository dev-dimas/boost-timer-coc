# **Clash of Clans Boost Time Calculator**

This repository contains a simple web project that can provide calculations related to boost time of Laboratory or Builder in the Clash of Clans game. The website is available in both Indonesian and English languages.
The website is built using Next JS and Tailwind CSS. Next JS is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static websites, while Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style your web pages using pre-defined classes. I built this website as a means to learn Next JS.

## How to use

To use this website, simply visit the website URL at [here](http://boost-timer-coc.vercel.app/) and select the language you prefer at the Navbar. You will then be presented with a form where you can input the following information:

- The number of minutes left for your boost duration
- The number of research or build time in Days, Hours, and Minutes

Once you have entered this information, click the "Calculate" button and the website will display the result of calculation.
